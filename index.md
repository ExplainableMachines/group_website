# Explainable Machine Learning Group Homepage

This is the home of the Explainable Machine Learning research group of the Department for Computer Vision and Machine Learning of the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. Here, we provide an overview as well as all the details on our ongoing and past work around Explainability in Machine Learning, including generation of explanations for black box models, inherently interpretable neural network approaches, and their applications.

{% capture news7 %}
 7/25 Happy to share the acceptance of *VITAL* at ICCV, which enables more realistic feature visualizations to understand neural network decision making, led by our PhD student Ada, and *Spotlight* at ACL, which supports users in identifying the effects of prompt and model changes led by the group of Michael Hedderich at LMU.
